Datasets are the most important item that you need for Learning Machines. Without the dataset there is no learning. Just like humans if there is no information, there is no learning. There are several types of datasets that LM requires, like training, validation test datasets. The kinds of data use could be numerical, categorical, time series and text.  There are a number of places where you can download datasets for examples to learn with or real data to do real thing with. In my first couple of programs I will be using fake datasets generated randomly in order to demonstrate ML process.
