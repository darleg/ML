# Machine LearningMachine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. At its core, ML is about developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Here are the key components:  1. Data: The raw information from which the model learns. This can be anything from numbers      and text to images and sounds.  2. Models: Algorithms that process the data and make predictions or decisions. These models      improve over time as they are exposed to more data.  3. Training: The process of feeding data to the model and allowing it to learn. During      training, the model adjusts its parameters to better predict outcomes.  4. Evaluation: Testing the model on new, unseen data to see how well it performs. This      helps ensure the model is not just memorizing the training data but generalizing to new      inputs.  5. Prediction: Using the trained model to make decisions or predictions on new data.ML has a wide range of applications, including:  1.  Image and speech recognition: Identifying objects in photos or understanding spoken language.  2. Recommendation systems: Suggesting products, movies, or music based on user preferences.  3. Medical diagnosis: Assisting doctors in identifying diseases from medical images or data.  4. Finance: Predicting stock prices or detecting fraudulent transactions.In essence, ML is about creating systems that can learn and adapt from experience, much like humans do. It's an exciting and rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our daily lives.
