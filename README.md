# Machine Learning
 Machine Learning is basically a subset of Artificial Intelligence just as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a subset of Machine Learning (ML). While ANN is kind of AI, so is ML, but in a broader sense than ANN. I have been interested in AI for many years. While starting up a ANN respiratory read up on ML stuff as well. I have been out of the loop for some time and was surprised to see how many respiratory there is on GitHub. There is probably no need for me to do one. Anyhow maybe, just for my own notes. I am not sure what kind of programs I will do yet. I will try to make good notes and it will be fun.
