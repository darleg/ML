# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. At its core, ML is about developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. Here are the key components:
  1. Data: The raw information from which the model learns. This can be anything from numbers 
     and text to images and sounds.
  2. Models: Algorithms that process the data and make predictions or decisions. These models 
     improve over time as they are exposed to more data.
  3. Training: The process of feeding data to the model and allowing it to learn. During 
     training, the model adjusts its parameters to better predict outcomes.
  4. Evaluation: Testing the model on new, unseen data to see how well it performs. This 
     helps ensure the model is not just memorizing the training data but generalizing to new 
     inputs.
  5. Prediction: Using the trained model to make decisions or predictions on new data.
